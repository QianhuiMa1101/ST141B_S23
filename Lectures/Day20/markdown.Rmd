The code  is in myFuns.R and runScript.R
to compute the actual timings and save the results in RDS files.
We then load them in the markdown and create the plots, etc.
without having to run the code to time the computations.

```{r}
source("myFuns.R")
tm1 = readRDS("tm1.rds")
tm2 = readRDS("tm2.rds")
tmv = readRDS("tmv.rds")
```

The definition fo URLdecode.v1 is 
```{r}
URLdecode.v1
```


Show the code from runScript.R but don't run it.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
tm1 = sapply(words, function(x) system.time(fun1(x)))
tm2 = sapply(words, function(x) system.time(fun2(x))) 
tmv = sapply(words, function(x) system.time(funv(x)))
```
