# Regular Expressions

+ Pattern matching in text.
+ Very common in data manipulation
  + Typically small part of a larger step
  + But essential tool & skill
  
+ Use them in 
  + R, Python, Perl, MATLAB, ...  
  + (UNIX) shell

---
# Conceptual Operations & R Functions

+ Find lines/records containing a specific pattern  - `grep()` & `grepl()`
+ Find where in a string the pattern is located - `gregexpr()`
+ extract the matching patterns  - `regmatches()`
+ replace/substitute  - `sub()` & `gsub()`
+ split a string with a pattern as the separator - `strsplit()`

---
# Pattern and Character Vector

+ Most of these functions take
  + the pattern to look for
  + a character vector 
+ Vectorized functions so process each element of character vector separately
  + give results for entire vector,
    + i.e., corresponding to each element of character vector.

---
# Specifying Pattern

+ Can be a simple literal string to find, e.g.
   + `grep("cat", c("catalog", "two cats", "concatenate"))`
   + `grep("#", readLines("offline"))`

---
# More Flexible, Precise Pattern

+ But we want more precise description of concepts  in pattern
   + match any character  - `.`
   + match one of several characters  - `[a&#]`  & character classes (e.g. [[:digits:]]
      + ranges - `[0-5]`, `[a-zA-Z]`
      + negation - not in this set of characters  - `[^0-9]`
      + named character classes, e.g. `[[:space:]]`, `[01[:alpha:]]`
	    + adapts to alphabet of the computer being used.
   + match either pattern.A or pattern.B at the same place  - `(ABC|other)`   (ABC|something else|everything)
   + match at the start of the string - `^`
   + match at the end of the string  - `$`
   + match the pattern a certain number of times - quantifier
      + optionally - can be be present or not - `?`
      + zero or more times - `*`
      + at least once   - `+`
      + exactly n times   - `{n}`   .{10}   [0-9]+[.]0{2}  "[0-9]+\\.0{2}"   123.00  123a00
	  + more than n times - `{n,}`
	  + between m and n times (inclusive) - `{m,n}`
---
# Continued

+ back-references () as "capture group" and then references via \\\1, \\\2
   
+ meta-characters - ., ^, $, *, ?, +, {, }, [, ], <, >, (, ), | and \

+ escaping special/meta characters
   + Use \\\ before special character, e.g., "\\\$"

---
# Ubiquity
   
+ These core features are in every regular expression language 
+ Also high-level descriptions of, e.g., word boundary, digit, ...
+ Additional features in different dialects, e.g. the perl dialect built into R.
   + Can be useful but not necessary to master.

+ There are many web sites with short summaries/cheat-sheets of the language.
   + e.g., [https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)


---
# Greedy matching

+ By default, a regular expression will match as far as it can.
+ Each term will match as much as it can
  + doesn't give back characters to allow subsequet terms in regular expression to match more.

---
# AND in Regular Expressions
+  match pattern that has pattern1  AND pattern2.
  + in that order, i.e. pattern1 followed somewhere later in the string by pattern2
```
grep("pattern1.*pattern2", x)
```
  + to do this in either order
```
grep("(pattern1.*pattern2|pattern2.*pattern1)", x)
```

  + Or perhaps better (but different)
```
grepl("pattern1", x) & grepl("pattern2", x)
```
    + this is slightly different
      grep("cd|de", abcdef")


---
# Contains specific words
+ Can deal with word boundaries in the pattern
```
grep("cat\\b", c("catalog", "a cat on a mat"))
```

+ But
```
x = c("catalog", "a cat on a mat", "c() stands for concat", "a cat, dog, bird")
grep("cat\\b", x)
```
  + does match end of string - good
  + but also matches `cat` in `concat`
```
gregexpr("cat\\b", x[3])
```

+ So use word boundary before and after
```
grep("\\bcat\\b", x)
```

+ For a collection of several words
```
grep("\\b(cat|dog|mouse)\\b", c("catalog", "a cat on a mat", "a mouse tail"))
```
